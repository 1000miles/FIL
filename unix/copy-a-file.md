# Copy & cURL a file


### Copy a file from local

File names in the same directory must be unique, means there can not be two or multiple files that have exactly the same name. If we want to copy the values of one file to another file, we have a few ways to do so.

**1. To copy one file to another file in the same directory, please do:**

```

$ cp filename1.rb filename2.rb

```

**2. To copy one file to another file in 2 different directories, do:**

```

$ cp this\_directory/filename1.rb other\_directory/filename1.rb

```
