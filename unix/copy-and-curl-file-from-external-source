# Copy a file

File names in the same directory must be unique, means there can not be two or multiple files that have exactly the same name. If we want to copy the values of one file to another file, we have a few ways to do so.

1. To copy one file to another file in the same directory, please do:
```
$ cp filename1.rb filename2.rb
```

2. To copy one file to another file in 2 different directories, do:
```
$ cp this_directory/filename1.rb other_directory/filename1.rb
```

3. To copy the values of a file from an external resource - let's say a Vagrantfile from a gist on Github - into our current directory of our local computer, we just do:
```
curl -XGET https://gist.githubusercontent.com/user/path/Vagrantfile > Vagrantfile
```
As soon as the values of the Vagrantfile from Github has been copied and pushed into our newly created Vagrantfile we are ready to start our virtual machine right away:
```
vagrant up && vagant ssh
```
